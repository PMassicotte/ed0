## Installation

```{r}
# The development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pmassicotte/ed0")
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ed0)

df <- tibble(
  wavelength = seq(290, 700, by = 5),
  ed0 = ed0(100, 12, 67.47973, -63.78953, 3, 330, 1, 0.05)
)

df

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wavelength, y = ed0)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
  

```

## SBDART

The `ed0` package use a look up table (LUT) created from simulations conducted using SBDART (link). SBARDT is a radiative transfert model...

The LUT and the original Fortran code to interpolate the values inside the LUT have been produced by Dr. Simon BÃ©langer.
